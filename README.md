# 2DRPG
A prototype 2D text-adventure RPG.

I have two prototypes for this type of game. The more complete & functional one is [2DRPG_v2](https://github.com/SkyMocha/2DRPG_v2).

This prototype uses the [LibGDX](https://libgdx.com/) library as a base.

An overview of both prototypes as well as video demos & screenshots can be found on my website [here](https://www.skymocha.net/Projects/RPG/).

## Current functionality
* Character creation & stats
* Different areas
* Music
* Combat
* Obtaining (but not using) items
* Quests

Note: This whole game/project is *very* janky, so I will just include everything under "current functionality"

## Why open-source?
I am open-sourcing this project along with others due to the fact I will never complete them. In the end, these prototypes are just me messing around and having fun! Hopefully they're of some use to you, or just a fun thing to look at :)

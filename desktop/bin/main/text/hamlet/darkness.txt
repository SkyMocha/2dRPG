An unbearable darkness fills your senses, creeping into your lungs. 
You feel the darkness fills you, and are taken aback by it. 
You breathe, getting used to the sensation. 
The hamlet, filled with life--- this darkness is the very opposite. 
A barren wasteland. 
You need to get in, and then out before the darkness consumes you.

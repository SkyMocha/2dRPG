As your senses cloud, you wake up on the damp, cold, ground.
Your eyes remain shut for fear of what might be around you.
As you slowly place your hands on the ground to lift yourself up, your eyes slowly begin to open to little avail.
Nothing can be seen around you for who knows what distance.
You are enshrouded in darkness.

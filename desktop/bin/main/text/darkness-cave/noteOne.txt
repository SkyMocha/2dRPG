“I have found myself trapped in this cave. 
Although I had drawn a map of my path, I cannot see it. 
Whenever I look at the paper, I see a blank parchment. 
This cave… the purpose of this cave must be to lose yourself. 
You go down to find the crystals, and once you are here, 
you are surrounded by the beauty and power, 
yet you are no longer yourself. 
I have found myself in this precarious situation. 
I believe if someone else reads the map, 
they should be able to get out of this wretched place.”
Next to the note is a map. 
However, you also find more notes from the laboratory worker alongside it.

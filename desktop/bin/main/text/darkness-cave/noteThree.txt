This note is stained in a dark crimson.
“I…. I feel sick…. I had no choice but to eat them…. 
I feel, like…. I feel that I may be rotting.
My worry is that I will become one of them. 
Luckily…. I have brought weapons to defend myself… 
This knife ... should do the trick…. 
I would rather die than become one of these zombies…. 
Goodbye. 
If anyone reads this, 
I leave the knife in case you are to find yourself the same fate as mine. 
Please, if you are able to escape, 
there are some things I’d like to say to those I love……………….” 
The rest of the note is covered in blood.

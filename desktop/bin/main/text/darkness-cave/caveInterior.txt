As you head in, you see a group of… 
things… 
that you cannot begin to describe. 
They seem as though they are mangled corpses, rot emanating from every pore. 
They seem to be wandering around aimlessly in a primal manner, 
as if their only desire is to feast on the living. 
As you begin to think of turning back,
you realize that you have forgotten the path you have gone down through this cave. 
The cave seems almost to want you to lose yourself. 
To slowly lose your mind. 
You have to get past these… zombie-like creatures.

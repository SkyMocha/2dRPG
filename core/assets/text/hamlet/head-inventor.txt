"Good evening, sir, welcome to our humble laboratory."
(break)
(1)"You seem to not be from here. 
We seem to be somewhere quite curious, quite curious indeed; 
at least that's what intuition tells us. More than just intuition- evidence. 
We have no choice but to make this hamlet our location for a laboratory. 
We have found ourselves here not of our own free will, it seems, and we must find a way out."
(break)
(2)"We believe there to be multiple planes of existence, 
and we are currently seeking out a way to find them. 
Something about where we find ourselves does not seem correct."
(break)
(3)"And so my intuitions seem true. 
Something does not seem right?
We have lived our whole lives here, everything is natural, yet everything is not. 
Something weighs on our minds. 
We here, us few in the hamlet, are the only ones who feel as though something is off, 
and we have been looking for people who think the same. 
Would you help us in our research?"

“We have a few experiments running, 
though we are in need of materials. 
Talk to my assistant, he can inform you on what we need to subsist. 
We personally cannot leave the lab often as the danger is quite high...  
you seem,” 
he takes a short pause before continuing. 
“fit for the job.”

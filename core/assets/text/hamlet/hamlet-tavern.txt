You walk into the tavern, central to the hamlet you find yourself in. 
There is a fight of seemingly no consequence going on at 
one corner of the tavern between three patrons.
Beyond that, there are patrons scattered about the tavern. 
You look around the different tables in this tavern, 
each individual one giving you a... different feeling.

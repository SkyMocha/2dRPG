As your senses cloud, you wake up on the damp, cold, ground.
Your eyes remain shut for fear of what might be around you.
You donâ€™t know whether this could be heaven, or hell.
As you slowly place your hands on the ground to lift yourself up, 
your eyes slowly begin to open to little avail.
Nothing can be seen around you for who knows what distance.
You are enshrouded in darkness.
You slowly get up, and realize that your body instinctively knows where to go, 
as if the darkness *is* your sight.

It is time to click play, 
to move forward, 
journey into the dark, 
and see what lies ahead.

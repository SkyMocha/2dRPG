As you stumble through the dark, you head down the road the murmur of a town.
You move forwards into the town, hoping to find some clues as to what has happened.
Along the road, youâ€™ve begun to think: Who am I?
What am I? As the realization hits that you may not be what you think you are. 
There is no knowing in this darkness.
The darkness does not only cloud your senses, but your mind.
Maybe this darkness clouds the minds of others as well.
It seems what you need, is a guide through this darkness.
And as a dread overwhelms you, 
you begin to wonder whether you shall make it out of the dark alive.
